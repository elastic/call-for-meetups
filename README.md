# Elastic Meetups: Talks Wanted

This repository is used to share and discuss talks for the Elastic meetups world wide.

Speaking at a tech meetup is a great way to share your knowledge, get feedback on ideas, and build your speaking profile, but it can be a little intimidating to start. Check out the [Elastic speaker guide](https://eemrich.gitbooks.io/elastic-user-group-speaker-guidelines/content/), which goes into detail on everything you might want to know about speaking at an Elastic meetup.

If you have any other questions, please contact us at **meetups@elastic.co**! We encourage you to send us a note, and we’d be happy to walk through this guide with you! And, we’re always looking to improve the guide — please let us know if you have any additions or changes you’d like to see.
